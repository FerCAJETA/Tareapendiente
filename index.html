    <h2>Raider Power armor</h2>
        <p>It is used by some raider leaders and high-level raiders. Raider power armor has the worst statistics of any type of power armor and has few upgrade options.

            A full set of raider power armor provides 500 points of Damage Resistance and 250 points of Energy Resistance. It can be cheaply upgraded to Raider II armor to increase the DR to 620 points. In comparison with the first two versions of T-45 armor, raider power armor has the same damage resistance but worse energy resistance. Raider power armor can be repaired with steel. This armor does not spawn by level.
